Bug fixes

- (!) navigation issue:  going to Caswell, then CEI, then Caswell takes you to CEI instead;
  more generally, going to CEI or Gallery messes up the navigation to anywhere else, including 
  Science and Track

- remove all console output -- this appears in the browser with processing.js

- cei minigame:  should reset before entering the game a 2nd time

- add this text to the school navigation screen:
   text("Use the arrow keys to move around the school.\n" +
       "Move to the edges of the screen to access more areas.\n" +
       "Have fun!"

- gallery images should have artist names (e.g. Kyra '19, Gabi '20)

- escape button hover effect not working in all minigames

Bug fixes

- (!) Science game is difficult to play.  Here's a suggestion:  arrow keys for
  movement, and space bar shoots in both directions (simultaneously).  Also,
  use an array list so the user can shoot a lot (and in both directions at
  once).

- Make track game more natural.  Reset state when game is over, so it can be played again.
    Add escape button.

- remove all console output -- this appears in the browser with processing.js

- cei minigame:  should reset before entering the game a 2nd time

- add this text to the school navigation screen:
   text("Use the arrow keys to move around the school.\n" +
       "Move to the edges of the screen to access more areas.\n" +
       "Have fun!"

- gallery images should have artist names (e.g. Kyra '19, Gabi '20)

- escape button hover effect not working in all minigames
